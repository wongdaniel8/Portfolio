# This makefile is defined to give you the following targets:
#
#    default: Same as check
#    make-check: Run integration tests on make application.
#    make-trip: Run integration tests on trip application.
#    check: Same as make-check + make-trip 
#    clean: Remove extraneous files.
#
# You can use this file without understanding most of it, of course, but
# I strongly recommend that you try to figure it out, and where you cannot,
# that you ask questions.  The Lab Reader contains documentation.
