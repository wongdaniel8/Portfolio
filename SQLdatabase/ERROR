Description with Reproducabilities: 
	
	I seem to pass most of the tests in the autograder about (2/3) but I recieve this odd error when the following is run. I think that whatever is causing this error is also causing many of the other ones to fail, and I can't seem to find it. Any help very much appreciated. Thank you! 

	1) In command interpreter, 	run the following: 
	load students;
	load schedule;
	select SID, CCN from students, schedule;
	
	OUTPUT: Error: unrecognizable command

	2) also in command interpreter, in the situation when 2 of the selected columns are the same (SID = SID), these same to fail (or perhaps it's directly related to problem above), but my own tests seem to not fail with these, so I assume the problem is in the command interpreter.

	select Firstname, Lastname, Grade from students, enrolled where CCN = '21001' and SID = SID;
