The following study is aimed at analyzing the behavior of manic depressive patients, along with other patients
such as those suffering from severe anxiety, substance abuse, and schizophrenia. Effort inhibition and reward sensitivity
are captured both through data recorded from this effort game, and through fMRI scans while they play the game. 

The script is designated as newgame3.py
It requires an MP150 Biopac system installed and corresponding dynamometer to run properly

This posted version fakes the MP150 and uses random values instead of measuring grip force
Pygame runs in 32 bit architecture, arch -32 python effort.py

We first meausure the user's maximal squeeze value in the calibration phase,
and then the user picks a lottery to play based off of how hard the user squeezes.

The outcomes and user decisions are recorderd in the file: _ID_choiceOutput.txt
