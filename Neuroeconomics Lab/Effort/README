The script is designated as newgame3.py
It requires an MP150 Biopac system installed and corresponding dynamometer to run properly

This posted version fakes the MP150 and uses random values instead of measuring grip force
Pygame runs in 32 bit architecture, arch -32 python newgame3.py

We first meausure the user's maximal squeeze value in the calibration phase,
and then the user picks a lottery to play based off of how hard the user squeezes.
