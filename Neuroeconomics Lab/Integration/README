Bayesian Integration Study of Social Perception Study

The goal of this study is to construct new models to integrate social perception cues such as warmth and competence
on different racial and occupational groups. We seek to discover if there exists an undelying multivariate Gaussian 
prior distibution for these ratings, and if we can predict joint target group perceptions based off of Bayesian modeling.

Raw collected data can be found in the .csv files

Parsing scripts for the data contain the string "parser" in the file name
parser18aug16.py is the main parser for data used in the study

Data Analysis, model construction, and prediction testing occur within integration.py

Graphical study results are shown within the directory "target_figures" and model predictions 
are shown in the .png files of the root directory
