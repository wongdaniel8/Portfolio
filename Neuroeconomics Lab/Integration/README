Bayesian Integration Study of Social Perception Study

The goal of this study is to construct new models to integrate social perception cues such as warmth and competence
on different racial and occupational groups. We seek to discover if there exists an undelying multivariate Gaussian 
prior distibution for these ratings, and if we can predict joint target group perceptions based off of Bayesian modeling.

Phase I:
	
	The user was asked to give both an overall rating for warmth and competence of a target group,
	and also her confidence on such rating

	Raw collected data can be found in the .csv files

	Parsing scripts for the data contain the string "parser" in the file name
	parser18aug16.py is the main parser for data used in the study

	Data Analysis, model construction, and prediction testing occur within integration.py

	Graphical study results are shown within the directory "target_figures" and model predictions 
	are shown in the .png files of the root directory

Phase II:

	The paradigm of the question was changed for users to also give a min and max value for the rating in question, 
	i.e. I am 80% confident that this person's warmth falls between LOW and HIGH, with an average of AVERAGE.
	
	Raw collected data can be found in the .csv file

	Parsing and analysis can be found in phase2Parser.py

	Figures for either racial or occupational group ranges can be found in the correspoding folders ___RangeFigures
